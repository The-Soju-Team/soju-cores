 * <p>
 * This object can be obtained from {@link Container#getSPI(Class)}.

 * requirement that we need to identify a {@link WSEndpoint} that has a specific
 * service/port name.
 *
 * <p>
 * For JavaEE containers this should be scoped to a JavaEE application. For
 * other environment, this could be scoped to any similar notion. If no such
 * notion is available, the implementation of {@link Container} can return
 * a new {@link Module} object each time {@link Container#getSPI(Class)} is invoked.
 *
 * <p>
 * There's a considerable overlap between this and {@link HttpAdapterList}.
 * The SPI really needs to be reconsidered
