/**
 * Root of the SPI implemented by the container
 * (such as application server.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Often technologies that are built on top of JAX-WS
 * (such as Tango) needs to negotiate private contracts between
 * them and the container. This interface allows such technologies
 * to query the negotiated SPI by using the {@link #getSPI(Class)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, if a security pipe needs to get some information
 * from a container, they can do the following:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Negotiate an interface with the container and define it.
 *      (let's call it <tt>ContainerSecuritySPI</tt>.)
 *  <li>The container will implement <tt>ContainerSecuritySPI</tt>.
 *  <li>At the runtime, a security pipe gets
 *      {@link WSEndpoint} and then to {@link Container}.
 *  <li>It calls <tt>container.getSPI(ContainerSecuritySPI.class)</tt>
 *  <li>The container returns an instance of <tt>ContainerSecuritySPI</tt>.
 *  <li>The security pipe talks to the container through this SPI.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * This protects JAX-WS from worrying about the details of such contracts,
 * while still providing the necessary service of hooking up those parties.
 *
 * <p>
 * Technologies that run inside JAX-WS server runtime can access this object through
 * {@link WSEndpoint#getContainer()}. In the client runtime, it can be accessed from
 * {@link ContainerResolver#getContainer()}
