/**
 * Provides a way to tell the runtime about stickiness of requests. In a
 * HA environment, a client's requests need to land on the same instance so
 * that a {@link com.sun.org.glassfish.ha.store.api.BackingStore} entry for a key is
 * accessed/modified from the same instance.
 *
 * <p>
 * A web service feature may implement this interface. JAX-WS runtime
 * checks if any feature needs stickiness of requests, and if HA is configured
 * ({@link HighAvailabilityProvider#isHaEnvironmentConfigured()}), it will take
 * an appropriate action. For example, in servlet transport, it would create
 * JSESSIONID cookie so that a typical loadbalancer would stick the subsequent
 * client requests to the same instance.
