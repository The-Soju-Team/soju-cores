 * {@link com.sun.xml.internal.ws.api.message.Message} implementation for JAXB.
 *
 * <pre>
 * TODO:
 *      Because a producer of a message doesn't generally know
 *      when a message is consumed, it's difficult for
 *      the caller to do a proper instance caching. Perhaps
 *      there should be a layer around JAXBContext that does that?
