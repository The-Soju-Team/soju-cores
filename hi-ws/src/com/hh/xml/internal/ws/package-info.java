/**
 *
 * <P>This document describes the architecture of JAX-WS 2.0 runtime. JAX-WS is
 * the aggregating component of what is called the integrated Stack
 * (I-Stack). The I-Stack consists of JAX-WS, JAX-B, StAX, SAAJ and Fast
 * Infoset. JAX-B is the databinding component of the stack. StAX is the
 * Streaming XML parser used by the stack. SAAJ is used for its
 * attachment support with SOAP messages and to allow handler developers
 * to gain access to the SOAP message via a standard interface. Fast
 * Infoset is a binary encoding of XML that can improve performance.</P>
 * <P>The remainder of this document will describe the JAX-WS runtime
 * architecture from the client and server perspectives.</P>
 *
 * <p>
 * <dl>
 *  <dt>{@link com.sun.xml.internal.ws.server Server}
 *  <dd>
 *    The server side portion of the JAX-WS runtime.
 *
 *  <dt>{@link com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client Client}
 *  <dd>
 *    The client side portion of the JAX-WS runtime.
