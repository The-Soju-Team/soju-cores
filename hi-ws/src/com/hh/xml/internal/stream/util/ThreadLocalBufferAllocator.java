 * This is a Singleton class that allows you to allocate buffer that

 * buffers - small (< 128 bytes), medium (<2K) and large (> 2K) as
 * well as three byte buffers - small, medium and large.
 * The local storage is activated on the return of the buffer.
 * The buffer returns null if it is already allocated.
